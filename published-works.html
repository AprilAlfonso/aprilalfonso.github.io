                <h4><b>BUSINESS MANAGEMENT</b></h4>
                <h2>Secrets of Model Managers</h2>
                <p>To understand the secret of employee engagement, the Harvard Business Review (HBR) conducted a “diary” entry research on creatives working inside various industries spanning 27 teams. The survey was based on subjects holding professional and innovative job descriptions. In it, they discovered the <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins">progress principle</a>. They observed that the emotions, motivations, and perceptions of people in a given workday — a.k.a. their “inner work life” — hangs on a single overarching factor: They need to make some progress in their work, regardless whether it is small or big.</p>
                <p>To be clear, the study already considers the fact that these people already find meaning in their job descriptions. As long as the meaning of work is clear to the worker, it turns out that the next essential push to keep the ball of motivation rolling is making progress. The underlying principle to motivate employees is to give them a sense of achievement. In other words: make sure each worker could make consistent, meaningful progress in their work.</p>
                <p>Long-term goals are hard to come by, but good business management ensures that daily progress could be made through small wins. Achieving at least one minor milestone on an uneventful workday could lean the inner work life to a major positive win. On the flipside, small losses can have as much, or even more, impact to employee morale.</p>
                <p>But what about positions that are more humble but just as essential to society?</p>
                <p>A person could achieve many things, but if they don’t care about the work, it wouldn’t matter to them if they ever made progress or not. There are also other types of work that are routine and repetitive, with no specific end to conquer. Their only relief comes from completing the eight-hour workday, which leaves employees to work for the weekend -- or the paycheck.</p>
                <p>The answer is much simpler than you think: Managers actually hold more influence on their team morale than they realize. A person could hold a terribly routine job, but a great boss could make it meaningful and even enjoyable.</p> 
                <p>Humans have an intrinsic desire to make work that matters. You could bet that the kids at school who didn’t excel in academics actually excelled in other things that mean more to them. The hiring manager may be in charge of finding the people who actually care for the work, but once the person is onboard, it is up to the team leader to ensure they know how they are contributing, and that their work means something.</p>
                <p>Crafting meaningful work is more centered on the individual’s values than to the society as a whole...Meaningful work could be as simple as contributing to the economy just by being part of the workforce. It could be helping out with family finances or taking part of a supportive, like-minded group. Sometimes, giving exceptional service or products is enough. The list for finding meaning in work is exhaustive. The key is to tug at the heartstrings of each member.</p>
                <p>This means that managers have to be personal when giving clarity to what the job would mean to their workers. However, please take note that this only needs to be done once or twice, in onboarding members or when they are observably discouraged. It shouldn’t be a primary concern to the manager unless the situation calls for it.</p>
                <p>Business managers need to lead the environment of their employee’s work culture. They are in charge of establishing a positive work climate so everyone could freely do the work they are called to do. The best way to do this is to model the right behavior, one event at a time. This usually means keeping cool in crunch times and understanding when the employee will fail to deliver as expected. It may also mean a prompt delivery of good news. It is essential to be intentional in setting the behavioral norm for the entire team as it takes a lot of emotional control. Therefore managers must learn to be responsive, not reactive in critical, high emotion situations.</p>

                <h4><b>PHILIPPINE / SOCIETY / OPINION</b></h4>
                <h2>Reading and Writing History</h2>
                <p>There are many things that I could complain about my school, like the fact that the soccer balls seemed to be injected with a special type of dense air to keep it from crashing into our school administrator’s precious landscaping potteries (soccer was later moved to an uninspiring indoor cement box, the notoriously humid auditorium  that smelled slightly of pubescent body odor, taking advantage of futsal being the “innest” sport to hit our school at the time, even if the rest of the world would not agree.)</p>
                <p>Although the books featured on the shelves were on my sister’s ‘spare yourself from reading list’ (which I strictly followed, as any loyal younger sister would), these books are great introductory titles into the world of reading and proves their standing in any average reader’s hall of fame — even if no reader thinks they belong to the average.</p> 
                <p>Titles like Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew were the most popular in my age group, the fourth graders. We read these books in between classes, during lunch, or whenever we got bored from wrestling with each other and running around. In my case, it took up the time I usually spent crumpling up my math scraps and balling it up in a wad which I threw and bounced on the wall ( I was short and I was always made to sit in the front left corner of the room to the chagrin of my seatmate, whose school uniform suffered from my reckless handling of my ballpoint pen).</p>
                <p>In particular, I loved the Harry Potter series when I was 10. Harry Potter, after all, started his adventures at the age, in a school setting that was -- well -- a more magical version of my own. But, I thought it was slightly incredulous that Bathilda Bagshot was the only historian in the magical world. I didn’t think it was very realistic, until college came.</p> 
                <p>As any other college student in the country, I had to take up the government-mandated History General Education course (to the younger readers: yes, we still had to take Gen Ed courses in college in my day -- oh, and we also had two years less of school) and got its required reading.</p>
                <p>I looked into my own country’s history records and found that JK Rowling was actually not that far from the truth. I was studying the same history book my sister had studied 10 years before me and that my parents had studied a confidential incalculable number of years prior. Even the historical dioramas we visited on a field trip for school once remained the same one my father had seen as a boy. In one class, we had to do some research only to find out that some parts of our history cites a singular source for the country’s story: that half a century-old book. It wasn’t even fully credible, some have questioned its biases. It’s a sad fact but true.</p>
                <p>I guess it’s probably because of the general notion that history is something that happened in the past, as something that could never change. It’s written in stone. However, that is not true. Not at all. Not exactly.</p>
                <p>Everything is biased. History could be rewritten. Perspectives change. There are the facts you should always keep but there are new discoveries that could place those facts in enlightening contexts. It’s possible to rewrite history. It’s dangerous not to examine various perspectives.</p>
                <p>But who is rewriting our history? That is the most important question to ask. History is not in the past. It is our timeline, a real-time documentation of our ongoing lives and identity as a people cohabitating in this lonely planet. Whatever drives our history lies on the people writing our story. Everyone has his own version of the story.</p>
                <p>We write our own stories for the people who comes after us mainly through how we live and what we leave. As part of the people writing our collective memory and passing it on in domino effect, we need to learn from the past, in mistakes and victories.</p>
                <p>Reading enables us to gage what really happened and separate truth from fact. It does not stop at just reading a bunch of words and accepting it as truth. It stops at finding the real truth in the diluted forms individual people renders it in in the search for identity and direction in this confusingly exciting, dreadfully cryptic, wonderfully fragile world we live in.</p>

                <h4><b>THEOLOGY</b></h4>
                <h2>On Forgiveness</h2>
                <p>Forgiving others is often much easier because forgiving yourself requires acknowledging you were wrong and understanding how wrong you were, whereas forgiving others often has this ego-boost of being gracious; although sometimes it also feels humbling to control your strength at the cost of being perceived as weak or the loser.</p>
                <p>Forgiving others also has external stimuli, like when you have to keep working with the person; so it forces you to face the hurt. Meanwhile, forgiving yourself manifests subtly in the subconscious so you don’t really have the triggers you need to notice that you are hurting. </p>
                <p>But mostly, forgiving yourself hurts because it requires you to accept the reality that you are not who you think you are, and so it has some grief tied to it wherein you have to bury the person that you thought you were or had been. </p> 
                <p>Sin has a way of putting us in a sort of identity/existential crisis where we lose our sense of self, our purpose, our meaning when we do not act in the way we were designed to be: to be an image of a loving God.</p>
